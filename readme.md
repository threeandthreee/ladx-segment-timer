## What is this

This is a tool for timing rooms and segments in LADX for speedrun practice. The timer updates on screen transitions.

## How to use

1. Download the repository and unzip it

2. Have python installed

3. Get your game running in your emulator

4. Run `timer.py`. You should be able to just double click it.

## Notes

This is for Windows only.

This should work with a few different emulators,
but I recommend just using [BGB](https://bgb.bircd.org/#downloads).
